For the lack of imagination I will go with the easy answer. I'll write up a cooking pasta algorithm below:
1. Poor water in pot
	- Fill pot halfway
2. Salt water
	- Add 2 tbsp
3. Boil water
	- For every pound of noodles add quarter of water
4. Add pasta to boiling water
	- Pour one pack of pasta in water
	- Do not break pasta
5. Stir pasta
	- Every few minutes stir pasta so it doesn't stick
6. Follow cooking time on package
7. When cooking time is reached taste pasta
	- If pasta is chewy it is cooked - remove post from stove
        - if not chewy keep boiling until pasta is chewy
8. Drain pasta
	- If serving hot- add sauce right away
	- If making salad - run noodles under cold water
9. Serve pasta
10. Enjoy pasta while it lasts

Bon apetit!
